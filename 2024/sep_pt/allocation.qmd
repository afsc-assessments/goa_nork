## Issue

-   Apportionment has been based upon area estimates from the **design-based** survey abundance.

-   Assessment uses a **model-based** index of abundance, which does not always align with the design-based estimates.

-   For consistency, propose to change apportionment to be based upon the **model-based** index of abundance

    -   Convergence issues due to lack of fish caught in eastern GOA

## Survey catch: raw data

Catch is the eastern area has always been low
