## Area Allocation of Harvest

The following table shows the recommended ABC apportionment for `r year` and `r year +1`. 
The apportionment percentages are the same as in the last full assessment. 
Please refer to the 2022 full stock assessment report [@Williams2022] for information regarding the apportionment rationale for GOA `r species`.
