## Area Allocation of Harvest

The following table shows the recommended ABC apportionment for `r year` and `r year +1`. 
Apportionment is based on the random effects model developed by Plan Team survey averaging working group, which was fit to area-specific design-based biomass indices through 2021 from the bottom trawl survey.
